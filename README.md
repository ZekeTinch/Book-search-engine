# Book-search-engine

For this application I started working in the sever folder first to make sure the functionality was correct in the auth and server.js files.

I then moved over to creating my schema file to create my mutations.

When it came time to start working on the client folder I made my query file then moved into the mutation file.

I fixed the functions in the app, saved books,search books, sign up and log in files by using the mutations.

NOTE 
This assignment was the most difficult for me to figure out it definitely helped me understand how to read errors and understand how to fix them.
